## Advent of code problems are over trained
The AI's where even recomending the part two to the problem with the example problems without being asked... just also solving part two.

Instead we will create 3 of our own problems, in the same style as advent of code, but not advent of code and not found anywhere on the internet. The goal will be to test their ability to solve a fairly convoluded problem with real data to read in and a real answer to give.
