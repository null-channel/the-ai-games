# the-ai-games
A set of challanges to test the abilities of coding AI's. Let the games begin.

There is a folder for each year, and the "template" under "TheAIGames"

I hope in the future to make this repo the defacto place to test your AI's against the best of the best. It would be nice to automate the process of testing these AIs, and i'm open to suggestions on how to do that for next year. I feel like all there will always be "how it interfaces with you" and thus human involvement, but I would like to automate some tests with defenitave scores.
