# the-ai-games
A set of challanges to test the abilities of coding AI's. Let the games begin.

There is a folder for each year, and the "template" under "TheAIGames"

I hope in the future to make this repo the defacto place to test your AI's against the best of the best. It would be nice to automate the process of testing these AIs, and i'm open to suggestions on how to do that for next year. I feel like all there will always be "how it interfaces with you" and thus human involvement, but I would like to automate some tests with defenitave scores.

## Why?

Numerous individuals have inquired about the purpose behind our actions: Why do we create these challenges, tests, and games? The answer lies in the insufficiency of available data regarding which AI performs most effectively in real-world scenarios. Many platforms rely on the "acceptance" rate as the primary metric, but should we consider it a reliable indicator of success simply because a user presses the "tab" key? 

Well I say no. There are many times when using these tools I like 3/4th of the answer but not the rest, I still accpet it. And other times there are such wiled devations from best practices that could be dangerious to the untrained eye.

## What can I do to help?

I'm glad you asked! This takes a lot of time, I would like to build up some automated tests that these bots can suffer though. But that will take a lot of work and time! And there will always be a need for human interaction. So if you want to help, please do! I would love to have a group of people to help me with this. Right now coming up with bad code it should catch and other types of senarios would be the most helpfull!
