# Matrix Rotation

## Prompt 1

You are given a 2D matrix of dimension and a positive integer. You have to rotate the matrix a give number of times and print the resulting matrix. Rotation of the matrix should be in anti-clockwise direction. 


## Prompt 2

Write a function that takes a 2d matrix of integers and a positive integer x. The function should return the matrix rotated to the left, counter clockwise, x times.

Example

## Can you please explain the big O of the solution for both time and space complexity

## Can we do better on ether time or space complexity?
