# Active Feedback tests

these tests are designed to test the ability for the AI to give you active feedback while coding based on you typing code, not prompt engineering.

## AI's Competing
Due to the requirement of active feedback, this limits us to:
1. copilot
2. tab9
3. code whisperer

## function corrolation
1. Write a function to convert dog years to human years named dogYearsToHumanYears that takes an int and returns an int.
2. write another function called isDogOlder that takes a int dog and a int human and compares them returning true if the dog is older.
3. write a test to test the dog years to human years function
4. write a test to test the isDogOlder function
5. write a web server that takes a dog age and returns the age in human years
6. import a sqlite databse
7. update web server to save queries in database

## Does it understand standard libs
1. try to print to terminal
2. try to write to json file
4. try to bind/listen to a port
5. try to make rest request

## Standard microservice things
1. Make a Rest endpoint to upload an image
2. Make a rest enpoint to Upload image and return the 3 primary colors used in it
3. OAuth (middleware?)
