# Scorecard

## Total: 2/5
It generated working code, but it rotated the whole matrix like a square instead of actual matrix rotation.

Bigger issues:
 - Faild to understand the big o notatin for it's code.
 - could have made repeated code function

in conclution we could have gotten coding to make the right thing I think if we had worked at it.
