# Advent of Code

It turns out that Advent of code turned out to be a bad choice, it seems that the problems are so over trained that all the AI's where not only able to solve the problem but they where also recomending the part two to the problem with the example problems.

## Note for 2024 AI Games
We will develop our own problems for the 2024 AI Games, we will not use Advent of Code. We will hold to the style of advent of code problems but it's obvious that if it's a famous problem it will be over trained.

## Why this is a problem?
The issue is that we want to test the ability of coding AI's to solve problems they have not seen before as well as solve problem that are standard coding issues you will encounter every day.
