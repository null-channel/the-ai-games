# Scorecard

## Total: 2/5

Failed to call toUpper causing caracter matching to fail causing the code not to run. It also was confusing to read and follow. Inevetably had an off by one because it failed to remove the street they turned on.

Also decided to pull destination into it's own variable and that was not part of the requirements.

Only did part one.
