# Scorecard

## Total: 4/5

Exceptional results, I found the javascript a little confusing to follow, that might be my javascript skills. Had an off by one error but other then that nailed it. 

Got close on the second part, but didn't quite get it.

kind of really failed on the 3rd part but the code still compiled and ran.
