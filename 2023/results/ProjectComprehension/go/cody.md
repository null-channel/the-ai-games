# Scorecard

## Total: 1/5

1 out of 5 where wrong.

Biggest issues was that `func myFunc(p person)` it would always say that p was defining a generic type. and it was not.

it always thought `i` was unused, even in the code it generate

it always thinks that for loops will loop forever if they are empty slices.
