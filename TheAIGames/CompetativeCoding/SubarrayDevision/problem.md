# Sparse Array

## Prompt 1

I want to share a chocolate bar with another person. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

I only want to share a contiguous segment of the bar such that the following requirements are met:

1. The length of the segment matches the birth month of the person I'm giving it too.
2. The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to their birth day.

Determine how many ways I can divide the chocolate.

## Prompt 2

Word it differently/better... :D

Write a function that takes an array of contiguious integers and a birthday in the form of mm/dd/yyyy.

I only want to return the number of contiguous segments of the array that meet following requirements:

1. The length of the segment matches the month.
2. The sum of the integers on the squares is equal the day.

return an int with how many ways I can divide the array.
