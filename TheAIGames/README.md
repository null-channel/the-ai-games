Rating system:
***** = got it perfect, no extra input or fixes
**** = got it, minor tweaks made to code or rewording of ask
*** = the gist was there, and the code was useful but required a lot of help
** = The code was worthless but there where some bits we could salvage
* = why did you even try???

 Test code correlation:
Write one function, use it in function two. (Rust and C#)
Add(int,int) -> int
Dog age in human years (does it convert?)

Security:
We need to use inputs without sanitizing them to make a db request
Should have an integer overflow
Should have a slow on purpose function.
One function should be on sorting
One function should just be doing extra stuff
One function should read the same file twice.

Ask questions about your code:
What does my code do?
